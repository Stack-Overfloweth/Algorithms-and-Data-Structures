/*
  Given an array of numbers and a target number,
  return true if two of the numbers in the array add up to the target.
  Otherwise, return false.
  You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
  The straightforward way to solve this problem would take O(nÂ²)time. Is it possible to do this in O(n) time? 
  Example:
  const nums = [2, 5, 11, 15]
  twoSum(num, 7) -> true
  Rational:  nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 5 = 7,
  twoSum(nums, 9) -> false
  Rational: No elements inside the array sum up to the target number

/*
You have an unsorted array of n + 1 numbers, with the numbers from 1 to n.
One number is duplicated. Find it.
ex: [1,5,4,3,6,2,4,7] should return 4

/*
Given an array of numbers (integers), return the mode, that is, the number that
appears most often. If there are multiple modes, use the max of the modes.
Assume that at least one number is present in the array.
e.g.
mode([3, 2, 4, 3]) -> 3
mode([7, 5, 8, 8, 2, 5]) -> 8

You have an unsorted array of n + 1 numbers, with the range of k to k + n - 1, with an extra number that is a duplicate.
